## Brief Description of App
.

## For Coders
### Description of Key Components:
*app.py:* Initializes the Dash application and includes configurations that are common across the application.

*index.py:* Serves as the main layout file where different pages are assembled and routed.

*pages/:* Contains individual modules for each page of the application. Each module defines layout and callbacks specific to that page.

*assets/:* Holds static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images. Dash automatically serves files from this directory.

*credentials/:* Secure place to store sensitive information like database URIs, API keys, etc. Ensure this directory is added to .gitignore to prevent it from being pushed to version control.

*components/:* Reusable components or layouts that can be shared across multiple pages to keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

*datasets/:* Folder containing saved datasets to speed up downloads and data processing

*utilities/:* Utility functions or helpers that are used across the application, such as data processing or API request functions.

*tests/:* Contains test cases and test suites to ensure your application behaves as expected.

### Best Practices:
*Security:* Keep your credentials/ secure and never commit sensitive information to version control.

*Modularity:* By separating pages into different modules, you can work on one page without affecting others, making the app scalable and easier to manage.

*Reusability:* Use the components/ directory to define reusable layouts and components, which helps reduce code duplication.

*Maintainability:* Organizing utility functions and having a dedicated test suite improves the maintainability and reliability of your application.
